<h2 id="about">📌 About</h2>

**Risk x Return** is a browser-based calculator created for a freelance project to assist in evaluating the impact of investment reallocations. It simulates how shifting funds across fixed income, variable income, and foreign assets affects both **portfolio risk** and **expected return**.

This was one of the author's first freelance jobs and was built as a lightweight, standalone tool using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
